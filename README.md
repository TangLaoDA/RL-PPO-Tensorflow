Tensorflow implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms  
Basic Policy-Gradient model is hard to trainning very likely,so the enhanced version has appeared.  
If you don't know basic Policy-Gradient algorithm or have no experience about training Basic Policy-Gradient model,I suggest you look at my project:"Basic_Policy_Gradient" first.  
This is an implementation of basic Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm to play the game:"CartPole-v0" and "Pendulum-v0".   
You can Change code to play other OpenAi Gym games. You can also Optimize this algorithm.
